# I-Feel-Lucky
Simple brainless-fun game just to make you and your friend happy...

It is a turn-base dice game ,the aim of the game is to capitalize your opponent's miss fortune and maximize your score to win [ is Just 100 they say's] and for every [1] you roll your score will be reduce and your opponent may laugh at you :).
